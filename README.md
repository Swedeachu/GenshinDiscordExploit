Want a stupid badge on your discord profile and don't want to install 70 gigabyes of North Korean spyware?

Well head on over to releases and download this program (or clone the repo and compile it your self after reviewing the code)

Streaming this window for 15 minutes in a VC to a friend will trick discord into counting it as quest points.
